# Cako
As the goal of the application is ease of use and to provide an interactive interface, extensive research has been done to gain an insight into the needs and behaviors of various users. The working of the application is made convenient and easy to use for the end user. In online shopping systems there are two parties who interact with the system, one of them are customer who wants to buy product and other the system admin who manages the system
The main motive of CAKO is to bring the cake shop online on users mobile phones which we think can boost up the cake business and customers are provided with many variants and designs of cake which being not available at the shop.
